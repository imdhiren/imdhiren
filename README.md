<p>
 

 
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with a passion for creating unique, authentic, and quirky solutions. I believe in pushing boundaries, thinking outside the box, and embracing unconventional approaches to software development. If you're looking for someone who is bold, personable, and determined to deliver ambitious projects, you've come to the right place!
 

 
## What I Bring to the Table
 

 
- **Experience:** With over 7 years of experience in analysis, design, development, testing, and implementation of various Internet-based applications, I've honed my skills across the entire development cycle. I'm well-versed in working with the Microsoft stack, including SQL Server, C#, ASP.NET MVC / .NET CORE, Visual Studio, HTML5, CSS3, and more.
 

 
- **Open-Source Lover:** While I leverage the power of the Microsoft ecosystem, I also embrace the awesomeness of open-source technologies. I have a deep understanding of popular frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, Less, React, and others. By combining the best of both worlds, I create solutions that are robust, efficient, and highly functional.
 

 
- **Problem Solver Extraordinaire:** I thrive on tackling complex challenges. As an exceptional problem solver, I have a knack for troubleshooting and finding innovative solutions. I'm not afraid to dive into the unknown and quickly adapt to new skills, technologies, or roles. With my energetic and determined mindset, no problem is too big to conquer!
